abstract: The relevance of the study is due to the need to assess the economic efficiency of technologies created during the development of complex space systems, as well as the potential for their commercialization in the form of exclusive rights to intellectual property. For this, it is necessary, at an early stage of the project, to assess the trends in the scientific and technical development of the industry and analyze their conformity with the terms of reference for the project. In this paper, we propose a methodology for determining the complex predictive criterion for the potential for commercialization of created technologies. This criterion includes scientific, technical, time and cost indicators, which are determined on the basis of the analysis of patent information. A feature of the proposed technique is that with the help of fuzzy logic, it takes into account the unique nature of complex space systems and the lack of close technological analogues on the market.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: XLIV ACADEMIC SPACE CONFERENCE, dedicated to the memory of academician S.P. Korolev and other outstanding Russian scientists – pioneers of space exploration «KOROLEV ACADEMIC SPACE CONFERENCE»
