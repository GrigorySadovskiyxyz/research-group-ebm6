abstract: The paper envisages the analysis of the new generation manufacturing-distributive
  systems. The particular attention is paid to the production function as the analytic
  instrument allowed evaluating the interrelation between economic results of an enterprise
  and production factors, which includes the cognitive production factors as well.
  The rationale for the enlargement of the traditional production functions by means
  of the transfer from the multiplicative to the logistic dependence has been analyzing.
  The results of production function modelling on the base of the logistic dependence
  have been depicted on the open data of a high tech enterprise from 2009 till 2018.
  The results of production function modelling have shown that the usage of logistic
  dependence has allowed tracing more precise the transition of production factors
  to the other path dependency. The inclusion of the cognitive production factors
  has allowed evaluating their contribution to the economic results of a high-tech
  enterprise. This work is still in progress and the presented results are preliminary
  and would be added and specified by the additional research.
