abstract: The features of the application of the system engineering methodology, technology
  and manufacturing readiness levels metrics when creating high-tech industrial products
  in the digital transformation of the economy are considered. The concept of manufacturing
  and economic feasibility of a perspective technical system is introduced. An approach
  to the economic and mathematical modeling of real options is proposed for a formalized
  description and decision support for managing multi-stage and interconnected processes
  for creating a goal technical system and supporting manufacturing system. The directions
  of further research are determined and the tasks of applied development of real
  options pricing models are posed.
