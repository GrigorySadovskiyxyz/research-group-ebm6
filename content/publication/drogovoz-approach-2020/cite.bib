 abstract = {The features of the application of the system engineering methodology, technology and manufacturing readiness levels metrics when creating high-tech industrial products in the digital transformation of the economy are considered. The concept of manufacturing and economic feasibility of a perspective technical system is introduced. An approach to the economic and mathematical modeling of real options is proposed for a formalized description and decision support for managing multi-stage and interconnected processes for creating a goal technical system and supporting manufacturing system. The directions of further research are determined and the tasks of applied development of real options pricing models are posed.},
