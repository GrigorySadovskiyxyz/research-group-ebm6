	abstract = {The proposed article is devoted to the important issue of monetary regulation of high-tech industry system under the effect of unstable macroeconomic situation. The proposed methods and models are an effective method of resolving problems of monetary policy. The emphasis is on the qualitative analysis of the impact of monetary policy and external shocks on economic dynamics in the country. In this work, we produced an interpretation of the types of monetary policy shocks. The factors of exogenous shocks are matched with manifestation of the shocks of preferences, expectations and technological aspects. For the strategic risks-analysis of total flow of risks a mathematical model is made. The model takes into into account the economic, technological shocks and financial instability factors. As the result a mathematical description of the status of economic actors and conditions competitive equilibrium in the economy is generated.},

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {This work deals with the important problem of risk management of high-tech industries. The primary goal of this work is to study the influence of uncertainties on the economic subject status. The paper describes the role and strategy of the Central Bank in the process of maintaining balance through the regulation of growth of the nominal wage over the tools of its monetary policy. The authors present the models of economic actors in the form of consumers of high technology products; companies producing science-intensive products; enterprises producing sub-products. The model of symmetric market equilibrium, taking into account inflation, the rate of release of high technology production and other factors, is presented. The authors create a linear model of economic and technological shocks and analyze the behavior and patterns of influence of macroeconomic shocks on the economic system. The economic model of the system in the form of the econometric strategy of the stateoriented production of high-tech products is obtained. The impact of shocks on the sustainability of the growth trajectory of the economic system is analyzed. The paper also presents the analysis of the dependence of the output growth of high-tech products from shocks monetary policy of the Central Bank, charge shocks, preference shocks and the degree of their influence on the result.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the role of knowledge management capability in the Russian high-tech sector. The high-tech complex plays an important role in the economy of the Russian Federation and accounts for 21\% of the gross domestic product. The results of the previous research have shown that among the three selected antecedents the engineering processes have the most impact on knowledge management (KM) capability. However KM capability did not prove the mediating role between these antecedents and enterprise performance. Moreover, the questionnaire used was not clear enough to respondents, and the data processing tool was not appropriate either. This paper presents the next step of the study where an improved questionnaire and a modified data processing tool were used. The main findings are the following: the positive impact of chosen antecedents on KM capability has been confirmed as well as role of KM as a mediator; the peculiarities of knowledge management capability in the Russian high-tech sector have been identified.},

The particular attention is paid to the production function as the analytic instrument allowed evaluating the interrelation between economic results of an enterprise and production factors, which includes the cognitive production factors as well. The rationale for the enlargement of the traditional production functions by means of the transfer from the multiplicative to the logistic dependence has been analyzing. The results of production function modelling on the base of the logistic dependence have been depicted on the open data of a high tech enterprise from 2009 till 2018. The results of production function modelling have shown that the usage of logistic dependence has allowed tracing more precise the transition of production factors to the other path dependency. The inclusion of the cognitive production factors has allowed evaluating their contribution to the economic results of a high-tech enterprise. This work is still in progress and the presented results are preliminary and would be added and specified by the additional research.},

	abstract = {The paper proposes the empiric research of socio-cultural factors’ impact on the national technology development. It is well noted that the rapid technology development gives an increase of living standards, boost country economy, and contributes substantially to the gross domestic product. Being intangible socio-cultural factors are still potential drivers to the technology development enhancement and play an important role in constituting national welfare.The aim of the present research is to empirically investigate whether socio-cultural factors have significant impact on the national technology development and whether Hofstede’s indices play a mediating role between chosen factors and the technology development. The literature review has shown that results of the similar empiric research are rather controversial. Based on a dataset from more than 100 countries we have designed and analyzed a second-order model that confirmed the impact of the chosen factors to the technology development at a national economy. The most unexpected result deals with the direct impact of the business culture (R2 = 0.92). The received results also confirmed the role of the human capital and the social capital. Hofstede’s indices play a mediating role in two from three cases: between human capital and the national technology development and between business culture and the technology development.},
