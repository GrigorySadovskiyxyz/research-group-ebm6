abstract: The proposed article is devoted to the important issue of monetary regulation
  of high-tech industry system under the effect of unstable macroeconomic situation.
  The proposed methods and models are an effective method of resolving problems of
  monetary policy. The emphasis is on the qualitative analysis of the impact of monetary
  policy and external shocks on economic dynamics in the country. In this work, we
  produced an interpretation of the types of monetary policy shocks. The factors of
  exogenous shocks are matched with manifestation of the shocks of preferences, expectations
  and technological aspects. For the strategic risks-analysis of total flow of risks
  a mathematical model is made. The model takes into into account the economic, technological
  shocks and financial instability factors. As the result a mathematical description
  of the status of economic actors and conditions competitive equilibrium in the economy
  is generated.
