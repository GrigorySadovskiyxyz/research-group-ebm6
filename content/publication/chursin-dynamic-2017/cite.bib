 abstract = {The proposed article is devoted to the important issue of monetary regulation of high-tech industry system under the effect of unstable macroeconomic situation. The proposed methods and models are an effective method of resolving problems of monetary policy. The emphasis is on the qualitative analysis of the impact of monetary policy and external shocks on economic dynamics in the country. In this work, we produced an interpretation of the types of monetary policy shocks. The factors of exogenous shocks are matched with manifestation of the shocks of preferences, expectations and technological aspects. For the strategic risks-analysis of total flow of risks a mathematical model is made. The model takes into into account the economic, technological shocks and financial instability factors. As the result a mathematical description of the status of economic actors and conditions competitive equilibrium in the economy is generated.},
