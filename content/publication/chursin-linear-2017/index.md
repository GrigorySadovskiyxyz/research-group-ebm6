abstract: This work deals with the important problem of risk management of high-tech
  industries. The primary goal of this work is to study the influence of uncertainties
  on the economic subject status. The paper describes the role and strategy of the
  Central Bank in the process of maintaining balance through the regulation of growth
  of the nominal wage over the tools of its monetary policy. The authors present the
  models of economic actors in the form of consumers of high technology products;
  companies producing science-intensive products; enterprises producing sub-products.
  The model of symmetric market equilibrium, taking into account inflation, the rate
  of release of high technology production and other factors, is presented. The authors
  create a linear model of economic and technological shocks and analyze the behavior
  and patterns of influence of macroeconomic shocks on the economic system. The economic
  model of the system in the form of the econometric strategy of the stateoriented
  production of high-tech products is obtained. The impact of shocks on the sustainability
  of the growth trajectory of the economic system is analyzed. The paper also presents
  the analysis of the dependence of the output growth of high-tech products from shocks
  monetary policy of the Central Bank, charge shocks, preference shocks and the degree
  of their influence on the result.
