 abstract = {This work deals with the important problem of risk management of high-tech industries. The primary goal of this work is to study the influence of uncertainties on the economic subject status. The paper describes the role and strategy of the Central Bank in the process of maintaining balance through the regulation of growth of the nominal wage over the tools of its monetary policy. The authors present the models of economic actors in the form of consumers of high technology products; companies producing science-intensive products; enterprises producing sub-products. The model of symmetric market equilibrium, taking into account inflation, the rate of release of high technology production and other factors, is presented. The authors create a linear model of economic and technological shocks and analyze the behavior and patterns of influence of macroeconomic shocks on the economic system. The economic model of the system in the form of the econometric strategy of the stateoriented production of high-tech products is obtained. The impact of shocks on the sustainability of the growth trajectory of the economic system is analyzed. The paper also presents the analysis of the dependence of the output growth of high-tech products from shocks monetary policy of the Central Bank, charge shocks, preference shocks and the degree of their influence on the result.},
