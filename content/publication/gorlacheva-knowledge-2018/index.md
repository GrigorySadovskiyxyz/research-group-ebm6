abstract: 'The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the role of knowledge
  management capability in the Russian high-tech sector. The high-tech complex plays
  an important role in the economy of the Russian Federation and accounts for 21%
  of the gross domestic product. The results of the previous research have shown that
  among the three selected antecedents the engineering processes have the most impact
  on knowledge management (KM) capability. However KM capability did not prove the
  mediating role between these antecedents and enterprise performance. Moreover, the
  questionnaire used was not clear enough to respondents, and the data processing
  tool was not appropriate either. This paper presents the next step of the study
  where an improved questionnaire and a modified data processing tool were used. The
  main findings are the following: the positive impact of chosen antecedents on KM
  capability has been confirmed as well as role of KM as a mediator; the peculiarities
  of knowledge management capability in the Russian high-tech sector have been identified.'
