 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the role of knowledge management capability in the Russian high-tech sector. The high-tech complex plays an important role in the economy of the Russian Federation and accounts for 21% of the gross domestic product. The results of the previous research have shown that among the three selected antecedents the engineering processes have the most impact on knowledge management (KM) capability. However KM capability did not prove the mediating role between these antecedents and enterprise performance. Moreover, the questionnaire used was not clear enough to respondents, and the data processing tool was not appropriate either. This paper presents the next step of the study where an improved questionnaire and a modified data processing tool were used. The main findings are the following: the positive impact of chosen antecedents on KM capability has been confirmed as well as role of KM as a mediator; the peculiarities of knowledge management capability in the Russian high-tech sector have been identified.},
